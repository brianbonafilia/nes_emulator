# nes_emulator
this is a learning experiment to build a nes emulator

So far we can play some basic games like donkey kong with not issues.  It is not currently built or tested to run crossplatform.

It still has a lot of improvements to be made, and when I have some time I'd like to add APU support and fix some of the PPU bugs.

With more complex games like mario there is some minor issues.
